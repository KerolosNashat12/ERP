A figure with no door onto it is not a feature, and a door nothing ever knocks on is not tested. The fix is one word; the test beside it is the point - it loads the page, records a loss through it, and checks the document behind the figure is in the list under it. Also: the storefront's home page ends with the catalogue now. The shelves above it are the shop's opinion - what is new, what sells - and this is the shop, for the visitor who scrolled past both without seeing the one thing they came for. Ten pieces and the way through to the rest, fetched after the page has painted so nothing above it waits, and dropped silently if it fails, because a home page already on screen must not go blank over its last shelf." >> "%LOG%" 2>&1
