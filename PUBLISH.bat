It used to close only when a navigation link was tapped, so somebody who opened the menu and then thought better of it had no way out: the till was underneath, visible and untappable, and the only route back was finding the same button again behind the panel. A drawer on a phone is modal, so it now behaves like one - a tap on the page, a tap on the dimmed area beside it, or the Escape key all dismiss it, while a tap inside it does nothing, because a menu you cannot read is not a menu. The page behind it stops scrolling under your finger, and the dimming is a real element that can be tapped rather than a decoration. The dangerous half of this is the failure mode, which has bitten this project once already on the storefront: a dimming layer that outlives its drawer leaves a dark sheet over a page nobody can touch, and an invisible one that still catches clicks is worse - the screen looks perfectly normal and nothing on it works. So the panel and the body carry the state together, set and cleared in one place; a phone rotated into a desktop-width layout clears it, because there the sidebar is part of the page and a leftover scrim would sit over the shop's own screen swallowing every click. The browser check asserts all of that from the outside - where the panel actually is, whether the dimming is visible, and whether it is catching taps - and finishes by asking the page what element is under the point a cashier would touch. 995 tests passing and six browser checks." >> "%LOG%" 2>&1
