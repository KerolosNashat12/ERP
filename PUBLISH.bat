He refunded an invoice in full and the month's revenue still read 200, because revenue there meant completed sales and nothing else - while the profit-and-costs report had ALWAYS taken refunds off. Two screens, two answers, and the one he looks at every morning was the wrong one. Every revenue on the dashboard is now money the shop KEPT: sales less refunds, with what was refunded said out loud on the tile rather than silently subtracted, and gross profit crediting back only the cost of items that came back sellable - a damaged return is refunded AND destroyed, so its cost stays. Second hole, wider: nothing anywhere counted what the shop LOST. A bottle knocked off the counter, a watch that stopped, a piece that walked out of the door - the stock level moved and the loss then appeared in no tile, no report and no profit figure ever again. الهدر is a number now: posted adjustments whose reason is damage, loss, theft or expiry, valued at what those goods cost, on its own dashboard tile and its own column in the profit report, coming off the bottom line. A stock-take correction is excluded on purpose - a miscount found and fixed is an error being corrected, not waste, and counting it would turn every stock count into a fake disaster. Also: the storefront logo is bigger and no longer fights the search box beside it - there were two rules setting its size and the older one, still written as a fixed height, quietly won; and the brands rail now runs the full width of its band with cards large enough to recognise a brand from, instead of a narrow strip down the middle of the page." >> "%LOG%" 2>&1
